# Quinns' nvim config

This config is based on ThePrimeagen's [0 to LSP](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua) repository.

# Instructions
- Install [RipGrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).
- Ensure you have the latest version of Neovim (this config was created for 0.9.1, I know it doesn't work on 0.7.2)
    - I've found the easiest way to get up-to-date versions of neovim on ubuntu is to build from source (the packages on ubuntu LTS are very out of date)
- Download the repo & copy the contents into `~/.config/nvim`
- Run `:PackerSync`
- Spend like three days changing all the little bits about my workflow that don't fit with yours
